Bill Tyers published hundreds of his guitar arrangements on his website, <a href="https://www.guitardownunder.com/classical.php">GuitarDownunder</a>, free for personal and educational use.  His site is almost 20 years old now and I don't know how long he'll maintain it, so I wanted to download what he has available.  I used this project to learn BeatifulSoup.
